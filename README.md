The code maintains a list of customer codes, and the number of times each code has been used for transactions (called count).

 When a customer makes a purchase, they are asked for their code, and if they do not have one, a new code is generated for them. 

The bill amount is then checked, and if it is greater than or equal to 200, the count of the corresponding customer code is incremented.

The code also allows for finding the customer with the highest count (most frequent visitor) and deleting the most recently added customer code. Overall, this code provides a simple implementation for tracking customer visits and purchases, allowing for analysis of customer behavior based on their transaction history.
